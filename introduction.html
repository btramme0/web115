	<ul>
		<li><strong>Personal background</strong>: I was born and raised in Charlotte. In my younger years I moved all over the country before eventually settling back here. I’m the proud owner of two small cats.</li>
		<li><strong>Professional Background</strong>: My first work in home renovation. I continued to work there until I eventually came of age and moved to the restaurant industry. I finished over a decade of work there, then moved on to retail work.</li>
		<li><strong>Academic Background</strong>: Had the pleasure of the public school system until the sixth grade. Afterwards I transfered to a private school to finish out my education.</li>
		<li><strong>Background in this subject</strong>: The majority of my learning about this subject is both from here at CPCC and my work environment. I have been interested in the subject for a long time, but have only been able to dedicate the time to seriously study the subject semi-recently.</li>
		<li><strong>Primary computer platform:</strong> Windows 11 64 bit desktop and laptop.</li>
		<li><strong>Courses I'm taking</strong>:
		<ul>
			<li>WEB-115: Web Markup: I’m taking this course to increase my understanding of the subject and learn new skills.</li>
			<li>CTI-130: OS and Device Foundation: I’m also taking this particular course to gain a better understanding and learn new skills.</li>
		</ul>
		<li><strong>Something Funny/Interesting about me</strong>: I’m a terrible bookworm, I’ve run into a wall from walking while reading more times than I care to admit.</li>
		<li><strong>Something else I’d also like to share</strong>: My current passion is to construct enough shelves to pick up a book in any room in my home.</li>
