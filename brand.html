				<p>
					First Page Books is a dedicated web based service to buy, trade, and sell books at an affordable cost. 
					The aim of the business is to provide a resource for people with an interest in reading. This resource should be able to quickly and accurately
					find the book that a customer is interested in, either from the current stock or acquiring the book from a third party.
					First Page Books will handle the acquisition of the books themselves with minimal effort on the part of the customer.
					While there is already an in house inventory and a number of trusted vendors First Page is always willing to look into finding new vendors.
					First Page Books is dedicated to making sure these vendors are a legitimate resource capable of providing quality products.
