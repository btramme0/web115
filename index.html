	<ul>
		<li><strong>Personal background</strong>: I was born and raised in Charlotte. In my younger years I traveled all over the country before settling back home.</li>
		<li><strong>Professional Background</strong>: I started in construction, but I've bounced around the customer service world after.</li>
		<li><strong>Academic Background:</strong> Had the pleasure of the public school system until the sixth grade. Afterwards I transfered to a private school to finish out my education.</li>
		<li><strong>Primary computer platform:</strong> Windows 10 64 bit desktop.</li>
		<li><strong>Courses I'm taking</strong>:
	
		<ol>
			<li>WEB-115: Web Markup and Scripting - This course is part of my degree so I want to get credit for it. Also I'm very interested in increasing my knowledge in the field so I'm very happy for the opportunity to learn.</li>
			<li>WEB-120: Intro to Internet Multimedia - I'm also taking this course to get the credit for my degree and personal interest.</li>
    			<li>WEB-210: Web Design - I'm taking this course out of intrest from being recommneded it from a trusted source.</li>
		</ol>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Something to remember me</strong>: I'm the worst kind of bookworm. I've loved reading all my life and it is my greatest passion. About an eighth of my house is a set of bookshelves.</li>
		<li><strong>Something else I'd like to share</strong>: I'm admittedly kinda shy, I have been bouncing in and out of the hospital since I got injured on my job. I found alot of strength from the experience, and I feel like a better person overcoming the challenges. </li>
	</ul>
